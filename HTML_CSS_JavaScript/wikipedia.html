            <b><strong>Data science</strong></b> is an inter disciplinary academic field<sup>[1]</sup> that uses <mark>statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, scientific visualization,
            algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data</mark>.<sup>[2]</sup>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
            Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (<del>e.g.,</del> natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).<sup>[3]</sup> Data science 
            is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.<sup>[4]</sup>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
            Data science is <q>a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods</q> to <q>understand and analyze actual phenomena</q> 
            with data.<sup>[5]</sup> It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.<sup>[6]</sup> 
            However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a <q>fourth paradigm</q> of science (empirical, theoretical, 
            computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology", <ins>machine learning</ins> and the data deluge.<sup>[7][8]</sup>
        </p> 
        <p style="font-size:20px">
            A <b>data scientist</b> is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to summarize data.<sup>[9]</sup>

            Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from images, text, sensors, transactions, 
            customer information, etc.) and emphasizes prediction and action.<sup>[10]</sup> Andrew Gelman of Columbia University has described statistics as a non-essential part of data science.<sup>[11]</sup> 
            Stanford professor David Donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their 
            analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.<sup>[12]</sup>
